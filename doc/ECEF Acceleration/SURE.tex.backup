\begin{abstract}
By presenting the design, configuration and required signal processing, this letter proposes a system for improved SAR imaging. Compared to conventional Spotlight SAR, the proposed system will generate imagery with equivalent or better resolution and significantly increased area coverage. The design and configuration are based upon a phased-array antenna in combination with the appropriate hardware to enable rapid electronic beam steering and to permit digitisation of multiple receive channels. The current state of technology is mature enough to construct all components of such a system. As a specific goal, the letter proposes a system capable of imaging with 10 cm resolution, a swath width of around 20 km and unlimited azimuth extent.   
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
This letter proposes a system for improved space-based SAR imaging. It describes the design\footnote{In this letter, the design is the phased array, including its dimension and element spacing, the required switching/routing circuits, the required digitizers, and the required hardware to permit changing the transmit and receive beam table on a pulse by pulse basis.}, which is based upon a phased-array and an appropriate switching network to allow digitisation of multiple receive channels, the configuration\footnote{The configuration is the way in which the system is operated and includes the pulse-repetition frequency and the transmit/receive beam tables at each pulse.}, which imposes a rapid electronic beam switching capability upon the design, and the required signal processing algorithm to compute the high definition imagery. The proposed configuration permits measurement in a stripmap-like mode, thereby offering, theoretically, unlimited azimuth extent. 
\par
The proposed approach significantly increases the area coverage (both in swath and azimuth extent) for the highest resolution imagery sensors on the commercial market while at the same time offering equivalent or better azimuth resolution. \Tbref{tb:reswidth} highlights the added value of the approach by comparing the swath width to azimuth resolution ratio for several active commercial SAR missions \cite{Brautigam2010}. To summarise, the potential ratio of swath-width to azimuth resolution is an order of magnitude better. 
\begin{table}[h!]
 \begin{center}
 \caption{Swath width, azimuth resolution and their ratio}
  \begin{tabular}{r|c|c|c|l}
   & {\bf Azi res (m)} & {\bf Chirp Len ($\mu\text{sec}$)} & {\bf Swath (km)} & {\bf Ratio}\\\hline
   RADARSAT-2 & 0.8 & 42 & 18 & 22.5\\\hline
   TerraSAR-X & 0.25 & 47 & 4 & 16\\\hline
   CSK & 0.35 & 31 & 7.3 & 22.8\\\hline
   Proposed & 0.1 & N/A & 22 & 220.0
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tb:reswidth}
 \end{center}
\end{table}
In addition, the strip-like nature of the proposed configuration allows imaging over an unlimited along-track (azimuth) extent. For most commercial SAR missions the Spotlight imagery footprint in ground-range and azimuth is approximately square. 
\par
The promise of such a capability, no doubt, raises questions about what unfavourable aspects of the system are amplified. What trades need to be made to realise such a system, are they physically feasible, and are they worth the reward? 
\par
For a start, imaging a larger area while maintaining a useful Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) requires a proportional increase in transmit/receive power. To avoid this problem, the size of the proposed system is on the order of 20m which is larger than most current missions (with the exception of RADARSAT-2). Also, as we shall see, the operating configuration benefits from the use of the entire receive aperture to maximise capture of scattered energy. Second, to function as specified, the operating configuration calls for the ability to transmit different beams from pulse to pulse thus requiring a rapid electronic steering capability. Third, the system needs a switching mechanism that distributes the receive sub-arrays to a multitude of distinct digitizers which, on the one hand increases hardware complexity and on the other hand, demands that more data is captured. These data need to find a path to the ground either through a link with increased bandwidth or by a mechanism that transmits less data over a longer period of time. Finally, the transformation of these more complex data into final image products requires the development and implementation of more complex signal-processing algorithms.
\par
The next section introduces the operating configuration under ideal conditions to aid in conveying the operating concept. The combination of this operating configuration with a desired azimuth resolution dictates the design parameters and defines the minimum PRF through which the maximum swath is determined.

\section{Conclusion}
This letter proposes a system for improved space-based SAR imaging, describing the design, which is based upon a phased-array and an appropriate switching network to allow digitisation of multiple receive channels, the configuration, which imposes a rapid electronic beam switching capability upon the design, and a suitable signal processing algorithm to compute the high resolution imagery. The proposed configuration permits measurement of a relatively large swath in a Stripmap-like mode, thereby offering, theoretically, unlimited azimuth extent. On the other hand, as demonstrated by the test example of 10cm azimuth resolution considered throughout the paper, the resolution of the imagery can be even better than the highest resolution spotlight imagery available from current commercial systems.
\par
Importantly, the state of current technology is sufficiently advanced to construct such a SAR system.
\par
As a final important consideration, we note that the design does not preclude the use of other traditional measurement modes such as Spotlight, TOPS or ScanSAR. Further, it provides the flexibility to implement other advanced modes such as HRWS and Ground Moving Target Indication.
