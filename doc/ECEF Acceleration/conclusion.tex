\section{Conclusion}
We propose a system for improved space-based SAR imaging, describing the design, which is based upon a phased-array and an appropriate switching network to allow digitisation of multiple receive channels, the configuration, which imposes a rapid electronic beam switching capability upon the design, and a suitable signal processing algorithm to compute the high resolution imagery. The proposed configuration permits measurement of a relatively large swath in a Stripmap-like mode, thereby offering, theoretically, unlimited azimuth extent. As demonstrated through a simulation of several modes, the geometric resolution of the imagery can be better than the highest resolution spotlight imagery available from current commercial systems while the NESZ is less than -25dB.
\par
Because the approach pushes the limits of space-based SAR resolution, a new wavenumber domain processing approach is developed and presented. The theoretical foundation of this processing method is a major contribution of this paper.   
\par
Importantly, the state of current technology is sufficiently advanced to construct such a SAR system.
\par
As a final important consideration, we note that the design does not preclude the use of other traditional measurement modes such as Spotlight, TOPS or ScanSAR. Further, it provides the flexibility to implement other advanced modes such as HRWS and Ground Moving Target Indication.
