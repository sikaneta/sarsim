  abstract =      {The TerraSAR-X satellite features an advanced X-Band
                   SAR based on the active phased array technology which
                   allows flexible operation of Spotlight, Stripmap, and
                   ScanSAR mode for various combinations and elevation
                   angles. It combines the ability to acquire high
                   resolution images for detailed analysis as well as
                   wide swath images for overview applications. The SAR
                   performance of the system is analysed with respect to
                   geometric and radiometric parameters. Long-term
                   monitoring of system parameters like instrument
                   characteristics or SAR image quality confirms the
                   continuous stability of the system. By launching a
                   twin satellite TanDEM-X for global DEM acquisition,
                   the TerraSAR-X mission is now supported by two
                   satellites. The approach presented in the following
                   shows how to keep the SAR performance for both
                   satellites, TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X.},

                   staring spotlight imaging in combination with an
                   extended azimuth pattern steering. The current TSX
                   spotlight modes are briefly reviewed, and the azimuth
                   steering limitations are discussed. Based on a
                   realistic TSX azimuth pattern simulation and
                   performance estimation using a Kepler orbit and the
                   WGS84 reference ellipsoid, the key performance
                   parameters are estimated for an increasing azimuth
                   pattern steering angle span. The azimuth ambiguity
                   performance is identified to be the driving
                   performance parameter. Experimental TSX staring
                   spotlight high-resolution images are presented. They
                   demonstrate and verify the envisaged performance
                   estimation. The paper concludes with a concept for a
                   high-resolution TSX staring spotlight mode that
                   serves as baseline for the upcoming operational
                   implementation.},

  abstract =      {A novel technique for design of Synthetic Aperture
                   Radar (SAR) is proposed. The main idea is that by
                   using a SAR in time sharing, it is possible to
                   acquire different strip images either to increase
                   azimuth resolution or to have a multi-image system.
                   This new method for SAR design overcomes the
                   constraint relative to the minimum stripmap
                   resolution, conventionally fixed at half of the
                   antenna physical or equivalent dimension. The idea to
                   acquire different strip images gives the name to this
                   technique: DIscrete Stepped Strip (DI2S). DI2S and in
                   general the applications using this acquisition
                   logic, are patent pending.},

  abstract =      {This paper discusses the ability of a SAR to create
                   high-resolution images with high sensitivity in a
                   stripmap configuration. Since geometric resolution is
                   driven by the effective azimuth beamwidth of the
                   antenna, it compares beam spoiling methods to beam
                   switching methods with particular attention to the
                   achieved SNR. It also formulates the effects of
                   element mutual coupling on the SNR. Further, since
                   existing systems may not be able to switch beams at a
                   rate equivalent to the PRF, this paper also discusses
                   a method to process beam switched data collected in a
                   burst configuration, showing that SNR and the
                   presence of grating lobes trade against each other as
                   the number of pulses per burst increases. Finally,
                   this paper investigates improvements to signal
                   quality offered by using a multichannel system, with
                   elements aligned in the flight direction, over a
                   single channel system.},
