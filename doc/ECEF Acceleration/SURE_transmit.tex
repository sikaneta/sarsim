\section{Transmit antenna}
Although the proposed design consists of $M+1$ subapertures, the requirements on the width of the transmit beam prevent transmission from the entire antenna. Transmission from the entire antenna would lead to a beam that is too narrow. Rather than route a finite power supply evenly across the entire antenna, one could instead supply the entirety of the available power only to the centre subaperture for transmission. Alternatively, one could transmit from the entire antenna, but with a spoiled pattern.
\par
One advantage to the first approach is that only the centre subaperture requires the ability to transmit (as illustrated in figure \ref{fg:antennaLenghts}), while the other subapertures can simply be passive receivers. If the system is to be used for other purposes, then it may not be desirable to limit transmit capability only to the centre subaperture.
\par
Note that one can easily narrow the two-way beam by transmitting from a larger number of T/R modules. This may be desirable if the user wishes for the data to be sampled above the Nyquist rate.
