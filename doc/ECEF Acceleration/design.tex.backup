\section{Multi-channel design}
Instead of beam spoiling or spotlighting, this letter proposes to time-multiplex a sequence of beams using an $M+1$ multichannel system, as illustrated in \ref{fg:fivechan} (with a five-channel system). A switching mechanism to route and combine the measurements from each phased-array element (i.e. form subarrays) into $M+1$ digitizers is required to realize this multichannel system. Although in this letter we shall consider a general $M+1$ channel system, we shall occasionally choose specific values of $M$ for illustrative purposes. The proposed system is also a uniform antenna array.

As can be seen from the figure, if viewed vertically, at each sampling point, the system makes $5$ measurements with $5$ different antenna patterns. If each of these antenna patterns has a beamwidth given by $\threeDB/(M+1)$, then at each sampling point, the system scans over a total azimuth bandwidth of $\threeDB$. The reduced beamwidth corresponds to a reduced required PRF for each channel according to
\begin{equation}
 \prfEffective \geq \aziBW/(M+1).
\end{equation}
\par
We now consider a requirement for an azimuth resolution given by $\resxDesired$. From fundamental SAR theory, for a classical stripmap mode, this corresponds to an antenna length given by
\begin{equation}
 \antennaLengthDesired = 2\resxDesired,
\end{equation}
which, in turn, corresponds to a required azimuth beamwidth of
\begin{equation}
 \threeDBDesired = \frac{\wavelength}{2\resxDesired}.
\end{equation}
If this desired beamwidth is divided into $M+1$ parts of width
\begin{equation}
 \threeDBEffective = \frac{\threeDBDesired}{M+1}=\frac{\wavelength}{2(M+1)\resxDesired},
\end{equation}
then each channel requires an antenna of length
\begin{equation}
 \antennaLengthEffective = 2(M+1)\resxDesired.
\end{equation}
The required PRF is given by
\begin{equation}
 \prfEffective = \frac{2\satv}{\wavelength}\threeDBEffective = \frac{2\satv}{\antennaLengthEffective} = \frac{\satv}{(M+1)\resxDesired},
 \label{eq:requiredPRF}
\end{equation}
which corresponds to a required two-way phase-centre separation of
\begin{equation}
 \phaseSep = (M+1)\resxDesired.
\end{equation}
Now, with a transmit antenna of length $\antennaLengthEffective = 2(M+1)\resxDesired$ and a receive antenna of the same length, the effective phase centre positions are given by  multiples of $\phaseSep = (M+1)\resxDesired$. The total antenna length, as illustrated in figure \ref{fg:antennaLenghts}, will be given by
\begin{equation}
 \antennaLength = (M+1)\antennaLengthEffective = 2(M+1)^2\resxDesired.
\end{equation}

\end{figure}
Let us examine what this means for a specific case of a desired $\resxDesired = 0.1$. As listed in table \ref{tb:Simulation}, a traditional stripmap SAR would have to be $0.2$ m in azimuth length to achieve this resolution. Additionally the required PRF would be $\prf = 75$ KHz for a satellite travelling at 7500 m/s which corresponds to a rather limited swath. On the other hand, with $M=10$, the required PRF is $\prfEffective = 6.818$ KHz which corresponds to a range-swath width of approximately 22 Km (minus any time needed for chirp transmission) which would be even larger in ground range.
\par
The choice of $\resxDesired=0.1, M=10$ leads to an antenna of length $24.2$ m with each subaperture having a length of $2.2$ m. This antenna length of $24.2$ m is only about $60$\% longer than RADARSAT-2.

It is useful to examine the implication of utilizing a traditional HRWS configuration that does not use a sequence of beams as proposed in this paper. With this design, $M+1$ channels transmit a wide beam that covers the desired range of angles corresponding to the desired resolution. A lower PRF is compensated for by the spatial distribution of two-way phase-centres at each pulse according to \eqref{eq:requiredPRF}
\section{Transmit antenna}
Although the proposed design consists of $M+1$ subapertures, the requirements on the width of the transmit beam prevent transmission from the entire antenna. Transmission from the entire antenna would lead to a beam that is too narrow. Rather than route a finite power supply evenly across the entire antenna, one could instead supply the entirety of the available power only to the centre subaperture for transmission. Alternatively, one could transmit from the entire antenna, but with a spoiled pattern.
\par
One advantage to the first approach is that only the centre subaperture requires the ability to transmit (as illustrated in figure \ref{fg:antennaLenghts}), while the other subapertures can simply be passive receivers. Of course, if the system is to be used for other purposes, then it may not be desirable to limit transmit capability only to the centre subaperture.
\par
Note that one can easily narrow the two-way beam by transmitting from a larger number of T/R modules. This may be desirable if the user wishes for the data to be sampled above the Nyquist rate.
\section{The equivalent traditional HRWS system}
The equivalent HRWS system also uses an $M+1$ channel system and also relaxes the required PRF by a factor of $M+1$. To satify the spatial sampling requirement, the two-way phase-center separation must be the same as with the proposed design which means that the receive antenna elements must be spaced by $2\resxDesired$ giving a total recieve antenna length of $2(M=1)\resxDesired$ which is $(M+1)$ times shorter than it would be with the proposed multi-beam design.
